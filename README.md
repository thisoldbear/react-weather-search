#react-weather-charts

Renders weather data in a [react-sparklines](http://borisyankov.github.io/react-sparklines/) chart based on a search to the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) for a city.

Uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management with [redux-promise](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware) and [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) middleware.

Create a new `config.js` file from `example.config.js` and add your [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) key.

Based on working though [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview) by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider).
